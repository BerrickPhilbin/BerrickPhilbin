<h1>Hi, I'm Berrick, an aspiring <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR-LINK-HERE">IT Professional</a> ☺</h1>

I'm 17 years old and currently enrolled in the **Course Careers IT Program** by Josh Madakor.  
I'm building real-world IT skills through hands-on labs, and using this portfolio to showcase my progress as I work toward my first IT role.
